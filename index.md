# LoopMaster

[LoopMaster](https://neilkatahira.github.io/EE-Emerge-2020-Loopmaster/) is a musical project created by a team of UC Davis [EE-Emerge](https://www.ece.ucdavis.edu/ieee/home/ee-emerge/) (EEC 105ABC) students. This project allows you to create your own musical melodies or riffs, regardless of skill level or knowledge. Three custom "instruments" interface together to output notes, chords, and audio manipulations based on the user's selections.
