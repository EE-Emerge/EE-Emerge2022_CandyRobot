Candy Robot is an interactive robot that picks up and sorts candy into their designated containers based on their color. Our project utilizes the base of a 3D printer, a homemade vacuum system, and an OpenMV Camera. Since the OpenMV camera has a built-in color sensor, we programmed it to control and toggle the vacuum pump when it detects a specific color, enabling the candy to be picked up by the vacuum tube through suction.


Built by EE-Emerge students in the Electrical and Computer Engineering department at UC Davis, this project is intended to promote engineering to the general public. EE-Emerge is a three-quarter long course designed for undergraduate students to conceive, design, and build interactive electronic systems in teams.
