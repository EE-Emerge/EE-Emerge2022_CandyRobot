# PCB Design

Our project uses a custom PCB to control the vacuum pump. The vacuum PCB is connected to a 12 Volt power supply, which is toggled on when the camera sends 3.3 Volts. The OpenMV camera has a built-in PCB that enables us to program and control the 3D printer.

We used the Altium Designer program to design our schematic and PCB.
