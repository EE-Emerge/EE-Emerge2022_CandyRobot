The OpenMV camera has its own Python-based integrated development environment (IDE), allowing for easy access to MicroPython libraries.

With features like a frame buffer viewer and a histogram display, we are able to obtain the coordinates of the candy and convert them into G-code to communicate with the printer through SPI and UART communication.
